// The simplest expressions are literals values. 

	//Literals are fixed values that you litterally feed into your script.
	//Literals include arrays, booleans, numbers, objects, strings, RegEx (regular expressions), and floating points.
	//Variables can change.  They are also expressions, as are built-in-values like true, NaN, and null.

	//The word new proceeds the simplist invocation expressions.  Invocation expressions call function methods.

	//A refinement expression gets to a component of objects and arrays.
	//We use .x to get object properties and [an integer] to get array components
	//The word delete procedes the simplest refinement expressions.

	//The prefix operator act on the variables after them.  For example: ++a and --a
	//The postfix operator acts on variables before them.  For example: a++ and a--
	//An infix oporator goes between two values.  For example: 2 + 2
