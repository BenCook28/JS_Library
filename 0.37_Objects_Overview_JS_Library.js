// Everything in JavaScript besides numbers, strings, booleans, null, and undefined
//are objects.  Numbers, strings, and booleans have methods, but these can't change (immutable).
//Objects are changable key: value collections.

//Arrays, functions, regular expressions, and objects are objects.

//An object is a container of properties.  Each property has a name and a value.
//A preperty can be any string, including an empty string.  
//A property value can be anything besides undefined.

//Objects in JavaScript are class-free.  Instead of declaring classes, JS declares templates.

//JavaScript's prototype linkage feature allows objects to inherit the properties of other objects.
//This feature reduces initialization time and memory consumption.

//Initialization the assignment of an initial value.
