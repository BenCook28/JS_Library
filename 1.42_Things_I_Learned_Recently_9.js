// After we connect a component to Redux,
// we pass in a desired variable:
// this.props.//variable name.

// With MobX, data automatically updates
// but it can be harder to trace
// the flow of data than with Redux,
// but Redux can be more verbose.

// We can pass styles in React
// as props, which we wrap in
// curley braces.  React styles
// use camelCase because they're
// JavaScript.
