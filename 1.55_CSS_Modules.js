// A CSS Module is a CSS file in which
//  all class names and animation names 
//  are scoped locally by default. 

// With CSS Modules, we don't risk
// reusing class names or overwriting
// styles accidentally.

// We can also import only the styles
// we actually need.

// There's also no global scope with 
// CSS modules.

// CSS modules are also familiar to 
// developers who know CSS.
