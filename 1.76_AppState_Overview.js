// AppState in React Native identifies
// whether the app is actively running
// so we can force logouts for security.

// active means the app is running the 
// the foreground.

// background means the app is running in
// the background because the user is
// on the home scren or another app.

// inactive results from periods of 
// inactiveity or transitions from
// one state to another.
