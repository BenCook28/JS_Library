//a <script></script> tags in HTML deliver comilation units, which are  sets of executable
//statements.  JavaScript considers these in a global namespace.

//var defines a functions private variables, which are only available in that function's scope.

// switch, while, for, and do statements use labels in their logic which interacts with the
//'break' statement which terminates the logic.

//JavaScript tends to execute statements from top to bottom, but conditional statements
//and looping statements alter this flow.

 // Important: curley braces which create blocks{} do not create new scopes in JS, so 
 //so declare variables at the top of functions.

 // In logic, JS considers the following conditional values falsy, which means JS will
 //execute 'else' statements: false, null, undefined, the empty string '', 0, and NaN.
