// Previously know as ES6

// JS hoists var declarations to the top of the available scope.
// JS scopes let variables to the nearest block and doesn't hoist them.
// A block is any code section within curly braces.

// Using (let i in arrayName) prevents hoisting in for loops with callabcks 
// and gets us the output we want.
// A function as an argument is a callback.
// ES2015 creates a new variable on each iteration.

// Variables declared with let can be reassigned but can't be redeclared
// within the same scope.

// Const variables are read only, while let variables are not.
