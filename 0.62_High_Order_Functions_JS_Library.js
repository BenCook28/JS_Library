// Functions are first-class objects in JavaScript. 
// Returning a function from another function is perfectly legal. 

// A higher-order function is a function that can take another function 
// as an argument, or that returns a function as a result.

// Javascript treats functions like objects.
// We can assign functions to variables in JavaScript.

// A callback is a function that gets executed at the end of an operation, 
// once all of the other operations have been completed.
// Usually this callback function is passed in as the last argument in the function. 
// Frequently, itâ€™s defined inline as an anonymous function.

// JavaScript is single-threaded, meaning that only one operation happens at a time.
Understand the techniques that closures and higher order 
functions allow us to use.
