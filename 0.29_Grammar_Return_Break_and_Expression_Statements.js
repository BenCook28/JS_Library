// Return statements either cause an early return from a function,
//or tell JS what value to return.
//for example:
if(a == a){
	return "Aristotle"
}
//end lines cannot come between return and an expression.

//Break statements cause JS to exit from loops statements and switch statements.
//you can label breaks so you exit from the labeled statement.
//JS doesn't allow a line end between the break and label.

//Expression statements can assign values, invoke methods, or delete properties from an object.
//We use = to assign values, += to add and assign, and -= to subtract and assign.
// === means strict equality, == means loose equality.
