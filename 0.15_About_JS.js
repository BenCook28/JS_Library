//History:
	// Became the de-facto language of the web when Java applets failed.  Gained worldwide adoption quickly.
	// and therefore has many bad features and rough edges.  However it is powerful and expressive and has some
	// great features such as those below:

// Great Features in JavaScript:

	//*loose typing: JavaScript forgives minor syntax errors by guessing at intention and
	//acting on those guesses behind the scenes.

	//*functions: Blocks of code you can re-use.  You can pass in unique arguments, which are inputs
	// to functions to these blocks you re-use.

	//*dynamic objects: objects defined as a function, which can incude functions inside of objects 
	//, also know as methods.  Objects are class-free. We can add a new member to any object by ordinary assignment.
	// An object can inherit members from another object.
	
	//*Object literal notation: Objects can be created simply by listing their components

	//*Prototype inheritance: objects can inherit properties directly from other objects.  Saves time.

// One huge negative:
	//*JS depends on global variables, which can appear in unintended places in code.  We can work around this issue.

// About JSLindt:
	//*An awesome tool I've used to see whether I've formatted JSON correctly.  It identifies bad parts.
