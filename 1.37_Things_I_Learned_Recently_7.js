// In addition to passing components,
// We can pass data from one component 
// to another using props.

// Flux makes it easier to see where
// data is coming from in larger 
// applications when data would
// otherwise pass into deeply nested
// components.

// Flux keeps data in a global store,
// and a dispatcher interacts with the
// store and changes the data.

// Developers should evaluate the future
// time savings and complex setup before
// deciding whether Redux / Flux are worth it.
