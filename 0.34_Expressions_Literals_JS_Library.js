// Please let me know if you're actually reading these.

//Properties can be specified as names or strings.

//We must specify literal names at combile time because they're not considered variable names.
//These name properties are expressions.

// There are number literals, string literals, object literals, array literals, functions, and regex literals

// Object literals have this format:
// { property name: expression, 
//   property string: expression
//	}

//with the last key value pair not followed by a comma.
