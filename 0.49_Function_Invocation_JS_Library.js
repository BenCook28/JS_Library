//If one function is already running, invoking a function stops
//the current function and passes control and parameters to the 
//new function.  

//In addition to declared parameters, functions have this and arguments 
//properties.  The invocation pattern determines the this parameter.
//There are four invocation patterns: the method, function, constructor,
//and apply.

//The invocation operator is () after any expression that makes a function value.
//Each expression produces one argument object value.  

//If there are more arguments then the function uses, the function ignores the
//exra values.  If there are fewer arguments, JavaScript passes in the value
//of undefined for those values.  Any type of value can be passed to any parameter.
