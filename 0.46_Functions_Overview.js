//A function in JavaScript encloses a set of statements and 
//can be used over and over again with different arguments.
//Arguments are what we pass into the function.

//Functions are the modular unit of JavaScript.
//In addition to code reuse, we can use functions to:

//*Handle information: passing around data and 
//doing different things depending on what we pass in.

//*Composition: Function composition is the process 
//of combining two or more functions to produce a new function.

//*Specifying the behavior of objects.

//In general, programming often involves building functions
//and data structures to meet requirements
