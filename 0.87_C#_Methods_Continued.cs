// Methods require a return type and return statement.

// In the method below:
string SayHi(string yourName){
    return "Hi " + yourName;
}
// the return type is string and is right before SayHi.
// The return statement is between the {}s.

// void indicates no return value.

// In C# methods, “static” means “relating to the 
// type itself, rather than an instance of the type”.
