//there is only one JavaScript number type.  For example, the expression below evaluates to true:

(50 == 50.0);

//in several other programming languages, the values would be considered different.

//The number is a 64-bit floating point, which is a binary value with 64 places.

//to create exponents, multiply the part before the e by 10 to the power of whatever's after the e.
//for example:

(100 == 1e2) 

//to see whether a value is a number, you can use the NaN function.  NaN syntax below:

isNaN("Hello World") //evaluates to true

//in JS there's a Math object with several methods.

//for example, Math.floor(3.14159) returns 3
