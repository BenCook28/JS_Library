//Object literals can have zero or more name: value pairs.
//An object with zero pairs looks like this:

var emptyObject = {};

//An object with three pairs looks like this:

var character = {
	"FirstName": "John",
	"LastName": "Galt",
	"Occupation": "Inventor"
}

//The quotes around the keys are optional as long as the key isn't a reserved word.
//We can nest objects.
