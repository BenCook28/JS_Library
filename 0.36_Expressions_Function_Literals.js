//function literals follow the following pattern:
// var variableName = function(Argument List){
	//Function Body
// };

//Function literal parameters can be seperated by commas if there are more than one.

//The function body includes variable definitions and statements.  Statements contain 
//executable code.  The parameters act as variables initialized by the invocation arguments.

//A function can have a name which can be used recursively.  Recursion is when something calls itself.
//A dream within a dream within a dream is an example of recursion.

//Here's an example:

var x = function(input){
	console.log(input);
}
