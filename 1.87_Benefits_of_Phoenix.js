// With the Phonenix web framework
// for Elixir, we can create
// components, forms, and their
// associated routes.  We can 
// query only the database data
// we need to query.  And the
// framework performs quickly.
// With containers, we can 
// avoid some code duplication,
// and label programs in ways 
// non-developers understand.
