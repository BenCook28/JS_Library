// Debuggers, like Node debugger,
// reduce the number of console.logs
// we need to write.

// We don't need to splice in order 
// to sort arrays.  If we do,
// the array will be undefined.

// The Lodash library contains
// code for arrays, objects, 
// and more within a functional
// paradigm.  JavaScript also
// contains loop types like
// forEach which reduce the
// code we have to write.
