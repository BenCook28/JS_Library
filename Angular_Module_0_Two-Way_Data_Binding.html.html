// ng stands for Angular directive.  ng-app dictates what part of an HTML view is an Angular app.
//The document below demonstrates 2-way data binding.
//The view is in the p tags.  The model is whatever someone types.  Angular passes this data to 
//the view as controller.
<!-- The ngModel directive binds an input,select, textarea (or custom form control) to a property on the scope using NgModelController, which is created and exposed by this directive. -->
