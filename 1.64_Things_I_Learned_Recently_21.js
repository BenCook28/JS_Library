// Instead of going through 
// the Android SDK process
// I meantioned yesterday,
// we could just adjust the
// version number and build
// number in the React Native
// folder > Android > build.gradle
// or something like that.
// then we could run the terminal
// command in the React Native docs.

// If wae get errors in Heroku logs
// related to process.env, we may
// need to add the production 
// variables to the settings
// tab of the Heroku user interface
