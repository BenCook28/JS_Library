// In general it makes sense to share business 
// logic and have a repo for this logic, and 
// directly copying code between separate repos 
// can actually make sense since the mobile 
// version and web version tend to diverge 
// and companies sometimes prioritize either 
// the web or mobile version.  With navigation, 
// sharing view-specific code can cause issues.
