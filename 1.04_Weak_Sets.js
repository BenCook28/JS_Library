// WeakSets also exist, and only accept objects,
// The .has(value) property returns a boolean.

// The .delete(value) property deletes, then 
// returns true if the value existed.

// We can't iterate over WeakSets, and we
// can't read values from WeakSets.

// We don't mutate objects when we use
// WeakSets.
