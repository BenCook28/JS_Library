// By themselves, "magic numbers" don't mean much.
// For example, the 28 in (if if arrayName.length > 28)
// is a magic number.  Magic numbers aren't clear to other developers.

// const creates read-only named constants like const favoriteNum = 28.
// const variables must be assigned an initial value.

// JS doesn't hoist const variables.
